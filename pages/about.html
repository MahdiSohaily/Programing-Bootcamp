                        Most of us are surely familiar with the phrase, “Lost in translation.” But if not, it generally
                        refers to words or concepts that lose their meaning or subtlety when translated from one
                        language to another.

                        The same is also true when “translating” or parsing educational content. I’m instantly reminded
                        of sitting in my ninth grade class, listening to the teacher inform me what Shakespeare intended
                        to convey when he wrote that particular paragraph four hundred years ago. “Here’s what he
                        meant,” she would say. And even at that age, I found myself thinking, “Is this actually what he
                        meant, or is this your best attempt at guessing what he might have maybe, possibly meant? And
                        how often was it the case that he meant nothing of the sort?”

                        The point is: things get lost the further you travel from the source. I can teach you about
                        Laravel, but no one will ever understand it as deeply as its creator, Taylor Otwell, who wrote
                        those original lines back in 2012. It’s easy to learn what a piece of code does. But it’s far
                        more difficult to grasp why it does so.

                        With that in mind, today, I’m proud to announce a special new category of series here at
                        Laracasts: CreatorSeries.
                    </p>

                        And more often than not - from my experiences - they rarely overlap. But rare does not mean
                        never. The best developers I’ve had the pleasure of knowing are often able to somehow magically
                        do both.

                        For the last several months, I’ve been searching for those very people, and doing my best to
                        remove whatever roadblocks might be preventing them from teaching you directly. You can probably
                        guess what those roadblocks are. Sometimes, it’s nothing more than a microphone recommendation.
                        In other cases, money is of course the issue. But in most situations, time is the hurdle. “I’d
                        love to do this,” they might say, “but I’m constantly in battle with time.”

                        I won’t tell you that every person I reached out to came through for us. But the ones who did
                        created something special. I can’t wait to share these new CreatorSeries with you. We'll be
                        releasing one per month.

                            with: when hiring, a certain percentage of job applications are instantly tossed in the
                            trash. It sounds harsh. It is. But it’s also the truth.
