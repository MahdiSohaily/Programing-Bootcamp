## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- The home page should have a link in the menu to the about page.
- The logo in the header links to the home page.
- When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.
- There are no guidelines for the mobile menu in the docs, but you should implement it so it is consistent with the design (colors, typography, spacings, etc.).
- The mobile menu should have a close (X) button that closes the menu.
- The section "Featured speakers" should be created dynamically in JavaScript.
